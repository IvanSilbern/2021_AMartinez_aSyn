Sets of scripts in support to the paper “Low-expressing synucleinopathy
mouse models based on oligomer formation and C-terminal truncation of
α-synuclein”  
`https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643391/full` by
A. Martinez & I. Silbern et al. 

Run the scripts one after another to obtain quantifications of
alpha-synuclein peptides.  
input quantification tables from Skyline are located in
`/Skyline_reults` folder.  
Original `.raw` files and Skyline sessions can be downloaded from
`https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022314`.

Run `00_Main.R` (it will source subsequent scripts one by one).  
Intermediate tables are saved in `/temp` folder.  
Figures will be saved in `/plots` folder.  
Result table is saved in `/tables` folder.
